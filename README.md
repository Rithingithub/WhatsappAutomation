## Switch case
In computer programming, a switch case statement is a kind of selection control system used to allow the value of the variable to change the control flow of program execution. The switch case statement is similar to the ‚Äòif‚Äô statement in any programming language. The switch case statement is a replacement of the ‚Äòif..else‚Äô statement in any program. The advantages of using the Switch Case Statement in the program are as given below:
<ol>
  <li>It is easier to debug.</li>
  <li>It is easier to read the program by anyone except the programmer.</li>
  <li>It is easier to understand and also easier to maintain.</li>
  <li>It is easier to verify all values that are to be checked are handled.</li>
</ol>
